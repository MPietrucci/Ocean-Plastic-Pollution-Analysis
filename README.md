# 🌊 Ocean Plastic Pollution Analysis

Exploratory data analysis of global ocean plastic pollution using R, focusing on regional distribution, material composition, and depth-related patterns.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the *Global Ocean Plastic Pollution* dataset (15,000 observations) to explore:

- Plastic weight distribution across major ocean regions
- Composition of plastic material types within each ocean
- Potential relationships between depth and plastic weight

The analysis was conducted using **R** and the **tidyverse** ecosystem, with visualizations built using **ggplot2**.

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Plastic observations are relatively balanced across ocean regions.
- Total and average plastic weight show limited variability between regions.
- Plastic type composition appears broadly consistent across oceans.
- No clear systematic relationship between depth and plastic weight emerges from visual inspection.

## 🧪 Methodology

The workflow included:

- Data quality inspection and minor cleaning
- Aggregation by region and plastic type
- Calculation of derived metrics (totals, averages, percentages)
- Exploratory visualization through bar charts and faceted scatterplots

All analyses were conducted in a reproducible R Markdown environment.
